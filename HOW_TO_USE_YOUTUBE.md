# How to Use YouTube Feature

## Two Ways to Create Flashcards from YouTube Videos

### Option 1: Automatic Transcript Extraction (When It Works)

**Steps:**
1. Go to "YouTube URL" tab
2. Paste video link (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`)
3. Click "Extract Transcript"
4. Wait 3-5 seconds → Generates flashcards automatically

**When it works:**
- ✅ Videos with auto-generated captions
- ✅ Videos with manual captions
- ✅ Public videos with English captions
- ✅ Most educational content (Khan Academy, CrashCourse, etc.)

**When it fails:**
- ❌ Captions disabled by creator
- ❌ Age-restricted videos
- ❌ Private/unlisted videos
- ❌ YouTube API blocks (happens randomly)

### Option 2: Manual Transcript Paste (ALWAYS WORKS!)

If automatic extraction fails, use this method instead:

**Steps:**

1. **Get the transcript from YouTube:**
   - Open the YouTube video in your browser
   - Below the video, click the **"..." (More)** button
   - Select **"Show transcript"**
   - A panel opens on the right with the full transcript
   - Click inside the transcript panel
   - Press `Ctrl+A` (Windows) or `Cmd+A` (Mac) to select all
   - Press `Ctrl+C` (Windows) or `Cmd+C` (Mac) to copy

2. **Paste into the app:**
   - Go back to the AI Study Assistant
   - In the YouTube URL section, click **"Or paste transcript manually"**
   - Paste the transcript into the text box (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V)
   - Click **"Use This Transcript"**

3. **Generate flashcards:**
   - The transcript is now loaded (same as if auto-extraction worked)
   - Click "Generate Flashcards"
   - Done!

## Troubleshooting

### "No transcript found" error
→ Use manual transcript paste (Option 2 above)

### "Captions disabled by creator"
→ This video doesn't have captions. Try a different video, or if you have the video script/notes, paste them manually

### Video is age-restricted
→ Use manual transcript paste method

### "Could not find captions" error
→ YouTube may be blocking the automatic extraction. Use manual paste instead.

## Best Videos to Test With

**These should work with auto-extraction:**
- Khan Academy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0Z8wLLPNE0
- 3Blue1Brown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk
- CrashCourse: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs

**If they don't work automatically:**
→ Just use the manual transcript method! It's actually faster (no waiting for API) and works 100% of the time.

## Why Manual Paste is Actually Better

1. **Faster** - No waiting for API response
2. **More reliable** - Works for ANY video with captions
3. **No API limits** - YouTube can't block it
4. **More control** - You can edit the transcript before pasting if needed

The automatic extraction is just a convenience feature. When it doesn't work, manual paste is your reliable backup!
